// https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/

// Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.
// You must do it in place.


// Idea:
// The idea is that we can use the first cell of every row and column as a flag. T
// his flag would determine whether a row or column has been set to zero.
// This means for every cell instead of going to M+N cells and setting it to zero we just set the flag in two cells.
